# bbb-microphone

When using Big Blue Button (BBB) and presenting, then your microphone is 
normally the only audio output stream. Thus, if you run an application that 
generates audio, then this audio will not be heard by the audience, except for 
the audio that is output from the presenters PC speakers and then leaks back 
into their microphone.

When using the Firefox browser, and enabling your microphone, then you get 
the choice of a "Microphone", or "Monitoring the system audio". Select the
"Monitoring the system audio". When you run an audio application then the BBB
audience will hear it.

Now run this program, bbb_mic_console_static.py, and your microphone will be 
added to the system audio.

WARNING: The presenter will need a headset, to avoid feedback. Thus the 
presenter must be remote from any live audience in a room listening over the
rooms public address system.

There are two versions of **BBB microphone**

* `bbb_mic_console_static.py` Which is run in a console window and its volume fixed.

* `bbb_mic_gui_dynamic` Which is a gui app that has widgets to adjust the volume of the microphone or to mute/unmute it.
